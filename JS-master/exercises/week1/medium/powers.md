# Powers

Write a function `powers` that takes an array of numbers as first argument, and a single number as second argument. Return a new array with all numbers in the given array mapped to the nth power given by the second argument.

*Example*
```
powers([1,2,3], 2)
// -> [1, 4, 9]
powers([1, 2, 3], 3)
// -> [1, 8, 27]
```
